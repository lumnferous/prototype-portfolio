### hellooo
- start from **index1.html** and if **index2.html** doesn't work, then open **index1(backup).html**, where **index2-nomusic.html** will open up
- It's the same exact thing as **index2.html** but without the music player because I realized the \<script\> I was using decided to just... not work...
- But if you open it in **live preview** or something it should work and you can see what i intended on it looking like!

Thank you for letting me do this ^^ once again have a great summer : ]
